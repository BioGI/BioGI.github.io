<h1 class="scholmd-title">Meeting with Dr. Brasseur</h1>

<p>Dr. Brasseur wanted to discuss the following four items on the agenda.</p>
<ul>
<li>summary of the meeting with Balaji and Yanxing</li>
<li>code advancement for intestines fed state with particles</li>
<li>advancements in development of fasting state intestine code, first without particles but with dual lattice</li>
<li>report I must write and FDA review meeting on Friday</li>
</ul>
<p>Farhad and Ganesh wanted the answers to the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the physics of the fasting mode? Specifically
<ul>
<li>Wave shape</li>
<li>Occlusion ratio</li>
<li>Differences from Fed state apart from geometry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the purpose of multigrid method in our project?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="minutes-of-the-meeting">Minutes of the meeting</h1>
<ul>
<li>Gino had no parallel multigrid code. Yanxing had 3 parallel multigrid codes
<ul>
<li>Lid driven cavity</li>
<li>Lid driven cavity with Villi</li>
<li>Shear flow past a particle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We got a hard drive that Yanxing had left behind</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fasting-state">Fasting state</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of drugs given to patients in the hospitals are in the fasting state.</li>
<li>There are receptor cells in the upper duodenum that recognize sugar and fat molecules passing through the stomach and send a signal to the brain. This in turn signals the entire intesting including the upper stomach to change and trigger the fed state motor complex.</li>
<li>When there’s no food detected, the intestine goes into the fasting state. The main purpose is to clean out food that is not digestible or simply has been around for too long or is depleted of nutrients.</li>
<li>The pressure in the intestine is measured and analysed as a <strong>Transmural</strong> pressure, i.e. the difference between the pressure in the intestine and that immediately outside of it (which is slightly below atmospheric pressure).
<ul>
<li>The max pressure in the fed state is 10-20 mm/Hg or cm/water (not sure).</li>
<li>The max pressre in the fasting state could be as high as 140-400 mm/Hg or cm/water.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The fasting state is characterized by 3 stages of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) * Phase I - No acticity - Largest percentage of resting time
<ul>
<li>Phase II - Uncoordinated activity - contractions/waves - No clear pattern - Smaller percentage than Phase I</li>
<li>Phase III - Very low occlusion ratio - Peristaltic waves - Very small percentage of the resting time period</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We expect very high shear stresses and high forces in the occluded region of Phase III waves as shown in Figure</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The volume of gut is also really small in the fasting state compared to the fed state. This is still not clearly understood, but recent research suggests that the gut contains pockets of liquid content for a total volume of 60-80 ml scattered across 12-16 pockets.</li>
<li><p>The combination of high shear stresses in Phase III waves and low local volumes suggests the following that are important for drug dissolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentration of drug is likely high within these pockets.</li>
<li>The confinement effects are likely larger than in the fed state.</li>
<li>The shear effects on dissolution are likely larger than in the fed state during Phase III waves.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A drug particle passing through the highly occluded region is likely to experience a huge spurt in the shear rate around it as shown in Figure (). Hence we would like to focus on the Phase III waves as they are likely to be most important for drug dissolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>We aim to quantify the dynamics of drug dissolution as one of the these Phase III waves passes through. We’ll model these waves as sinusoidal waves for now. There’s no clear understanding of the local dynamics and hence there is a lot of room for hypothesizing. We’ll do analyses like determining the difference in dissolution rate between Phases I, II and III and using the percentage of time spent in each Phase from the experiments at University of Michigan to quantify the dissolution rate in each phase.</li>
