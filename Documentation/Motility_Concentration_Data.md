# Specifics of the data:
	
* All of the data is currently in 10 Hz form
* The tube is currently designed so we have 4 groups of 3 ports. For the sake of specificity here are the groups:

	* Group1: Port 1,  Port 2,  Port 3	
	* Group2: Port 4,  Port 5,  Port 6	
	* Group3: Port 7,  Port 8,  Port 9	
	* Group4: Port 10, Port 11, Port 12

* Group 1 is the most distal grouping, while group 4 is generally in the esophagus.
* Within a grouping, adjacent ports are currently 5cm apart.
* The distance between groupings is currently 30cm (not quiet sure)
