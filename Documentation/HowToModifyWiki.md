# How these pages are created

Documentation pages are created using [Scholarly Markdown format](http://scholarlymarkdown.com/) and [scholdoc](http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com/), a fork of [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). 

# Why

One of the main reasons for choosing this was having the native ability to [scale images](http://scholarlymarkdown.com/Scholarly-Markdown-Guide.html#floating-subfigs) and having internal references to them in the text.

# How to start

Please see [How to install scholdoc](howToInstallScholdoc.html) to start generating or modifying these pages.
